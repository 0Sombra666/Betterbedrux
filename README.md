> Create a Minecraft Bedrock Server using Termux on Android

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In order to create our Minecraft Bedrock Server we need to download [Termux](https://f-droid.org/repo/com.termux_1000.apk).
After installing Termux, open it and wait until it downloads all packages until you can enter commands.
When that finishes enter this command and wait until it finishes.
```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/invinc1ble7/bedrockserver/main/setup.sh)
```
